# burger
### What the project does
Eat-da-burger is an app that allows users to add burgers to a list. When the 'devour' button is clicked, it moves the item to a different part of the screen denoting that the burger has been eaten and allowing the user to reorder the burger again.
### Why the project is useful
This project was useful in helping me understand ORM, connections, routing, and Handlebars.
### How users can get started with the project
All the user needs to do is enter the burger name and click 'Add Burger'
### Who maintains and contributes to the project
Project was built and maintained by Ryan Brutocao.
